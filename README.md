# Federated Learning Demo in Python using Socket Programming

A demo project that applies the federated learning concepts for training a machine learning models using the private data distributed across different clients.

The server and the clients are applied using Python socket programming.

The machine learning model is built and trained using [PyGAD](https://pygad.readthedocs.io).
